# Mapping the Impact of Heat Waves in India

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on assessing and classifying the impact of heat waves across different regions in India. It aims to highlight regional vulnerabilities and provide insights into the severity of extreme heat conditions.

## Background  
The project analyzes various environmental and climatic factors contributing to heat waves, using data from NASA Giovanni, Copernicus, and QGIS. It includes weighted raster analysis, reclassification, and state-level classification to map heat wave severity.

## Results  
The study categorizes Indian regions into different heat wave impact levels, from "Not Affected" to "Extremely Affected." The final classification provides insights into the severity and distribution of heat waves.
